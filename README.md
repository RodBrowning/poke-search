## how to use the Pokedex?

First of all, you need to clone this repo with:

```
git clone https://github.com/gabriel-brito/poke-search.git
```

And then you install all the dependencies with:

```
cd poke-search
npm i
```

Ok! Now you're ready to register every pokemon on your pokedex with:

```
node index.js pokemon
```

Or with the directly command:

```
node index.js pokemon [pokemon_name] - or - node index.js pokemon [1..151]
```

It will apear every necessary detail of the selected pokemon on your console!
